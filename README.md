## About The Project

I had no idea on what to do on GitHub, so I made this. 
Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane, built for the rapidly changing gaming industry and designed to be highly performant and secure. Wings provides an HTTP API allowing you to interface directly with running server instances, fetch server logs, generate backups, and control all aspects of the server lifecycle.

In addition, Wings ships with a built-in SFTP server allowing your system to remain free of Pterodactyl specific dependencies, and allowing users to authenticate with the same credentials they would normally use to access the Panel. (copied straight from https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings)

## Built With

* dpkg (for the package)
* Go (for Wings itself)

## Getting Started

Getting started is pretty easy so I'll explain in a little bit of steps.

### Prerequisites

To install this package, you will need:

* A package manager that can install .deb files

* Docker

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

* that's all? i don't know

### Installation

There are only 3 commands you need to run to install Wings.
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pterodactyl
curl -L -o ~/wings_linux.deb "https://github.com/ItzBenoitXD/wings.deb/releases/latest/download/wings-linux-$([[ "$(uname -m)" == "x86_64" ]] && echo "amd64" || echo "arm64").deb"
sudo apt-get install -f ~/wings_linux.deb
```
